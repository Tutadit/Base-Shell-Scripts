\maketitle
Hello Hiring Manager, \\



I can imagine the great fun it must be to go through piles of letters and resumes looking for those candidates worthy of meeting. I can picture the joy in your eyes as you read for the billionth time how 'hard working' or 'good at problem solving' they are, oh and you can't forget the good ol' 'team player'. Sadly for you I must break that exhilarating streak of creativity. You see, I was scrolling through the job listings, most of which held no appeal to me, when I came across Critical Mass, which I've never heard of before. After looking through the projects made by all you folks I was thrilled, I knew I had to get my hands dirty with your work. I like the variety of projects and the team strategy you use. Then you go ahead and taunt me with a specially crafted project for the interns? Sign me up! You give me a call and I will not disappoint. \\

Can't wait to meet \\

Juan Pablo, \\
You can call me JP \\
