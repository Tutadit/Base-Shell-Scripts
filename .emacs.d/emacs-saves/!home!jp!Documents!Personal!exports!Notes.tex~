\chapter*{November}

\section*{Kianah Banana}
\label{sec:org97012cf}
\begin{verse}
I sit alone, in a crowded place\\
My mind a brick, swallowed by darkness\\
The warmest hug by the cold unknown\\
Comfort blooming through my absence\\
\vspace*{1em}
I see life fly by, without a trace\\
Memory, a thought that fades away\\
My broken soul an empty place\\
Numbly isolated, I decay\\
\vspace*{1em}
Decisions made by someone else\\
A brute, disguised by peace\\
My world rots and falls apart\\
The audience, only me\\
\vspace*{1em}
Here I am, a bleak existence\\
Pleasure running through my veins\\
From them, I need assistance\\
A way to break out of this chains\\
\vspace*{1em}
---\\
\vspace*{1em}
Pay attention, you sad chump\\
You're so desperate to find a way\\
Yet you quit on the first bump\\
\vspace*{1em}
You keep asking for assistance\\
For some way to make repairs\\
But you never make the distance\\
Between here and in there\\
\vspace*{1em}
I don't think you get it kid\\
I can tell you what to think\\
I can tell you what to do\\
I can give you opportunity\\
But there is nothing without you\\
\end{verse}
\section*{A poem}
\label{sec:org7237c3a}
\begin{verse}
This is a line of my poem\\
This second one follows it\\
Make it flow with low hum\\
Das it now is lit\\
\end{verse}
\section*{I'm tired}
\label{sec:orgc4f6f27}
\begin{verse}
I sit here by myself\\
Wondering what's next\\
Have to write some papers\\
But I ain't about the text\\
\end{verse}
\chapter*{December}
\label{sec:org3bd5695}
\section*{Here is me}
\label{sec:orgc828794}
You is you
Nobody else 

Why you
who knows

You in control

It's doable 
It's worth it.

Grow up
\section*{There is why}
\label{sec:orgf8d61b2}
Do you exist in the same way that a rock exists
Or are you just a fluke of time.
Are you physical? 
who knows
\section*{Me}
\label{sec:org1188995}
\begin{verse}
\emph{\textbf{I}} exist\\
What am I?\\
\vspace*{1em}
My thoughts me?\\
My body me?\\
My feelings me?\\
My memories me?\\
My knowledge me?\\
\vspace*{1em}
Here is the thing\\
I was born not too long ago\\
When this happened I had\\
None of the memories\\
None of the knowledge\\
None of the feelings\\
None of the thoughts\\
None of the body\\
That make up my existence today\\
\vspace*{1em}
Ok cool\\
So what did I have?\\
Me\\
\vspace*{1em}
Consciousness\\
\end{verse}
\section*{All of it}
\label{sec:org4ee5f40}
\begin{verse}
Everything is made up of the same essence\\
Everything is energy\\
\vspace*{1em}
Suppose we have a box that contains everything\\
There is no thing outside of the box\\
At this point the box cannot change\\
If there is no change then there is no time\\
There is no place there is no thing\\
There is nothing\\
\vspace*{1em}
Everything leads to nothing\\
\vspace*{1em}
Now \emph{nothing} is impossible\\
It cannot be, for if it could\\
it would stop being nothing\\
it would be something that is\\
\vspace*{1em}
So nothing is impossible, yet everything is nothing\\
So everything is impossible. It cannot be.\\
\vspace*{1em}
So this means that no thing is everything. Because as soon\\
as something becomes everything then it ceases to exist.\\
\end{verse}
