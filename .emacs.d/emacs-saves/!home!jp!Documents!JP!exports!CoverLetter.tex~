\maketitle
Hello Hiring Manager, \\



I would like to express my interest in joining your team for the Administrative Support III position, I believe the skill-set and experience I posses will render me a great asset. I have worked in various industries raging from costumer service to logistic designs both with teams and solo. I am going on my third year of Computer Science at the University of Calgary, within them three years I have learned to manage my time in order to fit school and work, without compromising the quality of my work. My parents taught me the value of work from a young age, allowing me to build a skill set worthy of a job. I would appreciate the opportunity of an interview and the chance to prove a worthy team member

Thank you.

Juan Pablo, \\

call me JP \\
