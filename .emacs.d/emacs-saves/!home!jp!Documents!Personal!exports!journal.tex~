\begin{enumerate}
\item Discussion leads to duh moment
\label{sec:org35c7344}
So today I was discussing the subjectivity of color with Emma and my point was simply to say that we had no way of recording the subjective experience of color by anyone. So that one cannot say that everyone sees color the same way. She was hesitant about my point and I felt as if I wasn't good enough with my communication skills in order to make my point clear and concise. I felt trapped and dumb, as I could not articulate any coherent thought or train of thoughts that would bring my idea to life. So I have a new goal now, kind of:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Be more coherent and capable of expressing my ideas}
\end{itemize}

  Anyway I also noticed that my frustration with my inability to make myself understood made me impatient. I felt as if I was dumb and this made me upset to the point were I saw Emma as dumb. Upon reflection I don't like it. I must be more humble than that, but I am also disappointed that I wasn't capable. Anyway, growing up.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Weird dreams
\label{sec:org8f10703}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Giraffe
\label{sec:org0c585ed}
In my garage with the door wide open, me and Ernest chilling. I have a gun, battery operated yet shoots bullets. Gotta pull the trigger once to warm up and once more to shoot. We go outside and start hunting, not sure if we are hunting animals and people or just animals. I kill something (barely remember what). I see a giraffe and go up to it, I aim and warm up to shoot but when I shoot nothing happens, I try again and nothing happens. Ernest comes over and looks at my gun, figures out I'm out of bullets. He looks at the giraffe and maybe shoots at it with his gun, not sure. He takes the giraffe to the garage and lights up a smoke for her. Ernest and the giraffe go in the house alone and from the outside I can see that they are having an intense discussion.

\item Soldier
\label{sec:orgcd7de53}
I am a soldier with a sniper rifle. I am outside some base. I feel bored and using my rifle I scope around, I find three figures, cannot make out their faces. I shoot one, head shot. The other two freak out and come running towards the base. They are just kids, I kill them both. Feel no remorse and everything is very matter-of-fact.
