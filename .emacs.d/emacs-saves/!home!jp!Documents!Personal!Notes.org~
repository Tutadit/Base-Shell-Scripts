*** Kianah Banana
    #+BEGIN_VERSE
    I sit alone, in a crowded place
    My mind a brick, swallowed by darkness
    The warmest hug by the cold unknown
    Comfort blooming through my absence
    
    I see life fly by, without a trace
    Memory, a thought that fades away
    My broken soul an empty place
    Numbly isolated, I decay
    
    Decisions made by someone else
    A brute, disguised by peace
    My world rots and falls apart
    The audience, only me

    Here I am, a bleak existence
    Pleasure running through my veins
    From them, I need assistance
    A way to break out of this chains

    ---
    
    Pay attention, you sad chump
    You're so desperate to find a way
    Yet you quit on the first bump
    
    You keep asking for assistance
    For some way to make repairs
    But you never make the distance
    Between here and in there

    I don't think you get it kid
    I can tell you what to think
    I can tell you what to do
    I can give you opportunity
    But there is nothing without you
    #+END_VERSE
*** A poem
    #+BEGIN_VERSE
    This is a line of my poem
    This second one follows it
    Make it flow with low hum
    Das it now is lit
    #+END_VERSE
*** I'm tired
     #+BEGIN_VERSE
     I sit here by myself
     Wondering what's next
     Have to write some papers
     But I ain't about the text
     #+END_VERSE
** December
*** Here is me
    You is you
    Nobody else 
    
    Why you
    who knows
    
    You in control
    
    It's doable 
    It's worth it.

    Grow up
*** There is why
    Do you exist in the same way that a rock exists
    Or are you just a fluke of time.
    Are you physical? 
    who knows
    #+BEGIN_VERSE
    We are all the same
    One or the other
    
    #+END_VERSE
*** Me
    #+BEGIN_VERSE
    /*I*/ exist
    What am I?
    
    My thoughts me?
    My body me?
    My feelings me?
    My memories me?
    My knowledge me?

    Here is the thing
    I was born not too long ago
    When this happened I had 
    None of the memories
    None of the knowledge
    None of the feelings
    None of the thoughts
    None of the body 
    That make up my existence today
    
    Ok cool
    So what did I have?
    Me
    
    Consciousness
    #+END_VERSE
*** All of it
    #+BEGIN_VERSE    
    Everything is made up of the same essence
    Everything is energy
    
    Suppose we have a box that contains everything
    There is no thing outside of the box
    At this point the box cannot change 
    If there is no change then there is no time
    There is no place there is no thing
    There is nothing

    Everything leads to nothing

    Now /nothing/ is impossible 
    It cannot be, for if it could
    it would stop being nothing
    it would be something that is 

    So nothing is impossible, yet everything is nothing
    So everything is impossible. It cannot be.

    So this means that no thing is everything. Because as soon
    as something becomes everything then it ceases to exist.
