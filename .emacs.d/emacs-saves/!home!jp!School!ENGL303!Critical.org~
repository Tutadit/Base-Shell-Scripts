The first insights into David's psyche reveal his potent fear of intimacy as "[in] the field of sex his temperament, though intense, has never been passionate". Not only is the fear portrayed onto his romantic lifestyle but also shown in his work, as David "has no respect for the material he teaches, he makes no impression on his students". He resorts to paying for sex in order to gratify his needs, and in his endeavors he is "surprise[d]...that ninety minutes a week of a woman's company are enough to make him happy, who used to think he needed a wife, a home, a marriage". David's past, specifically the way he was brought up, reveals the atribute that lead up to his manner. David, being raised by woman, surrounded by only woman his entire life, from his mother, to his wife, to his mistresses, to his daughter, allows him to become "a lover of women and, to an extent, a womanizer". However, it is the way by which he depicts his love towards them that uncover the root of his fears, that is his method of dealing with loss. 

  In his young age David had his way with woman, a smooth charisma allowed him to  possess a "certain degree of magnetism" that he could rely on. As David grew into a middle aged man this gift disappeared, and "overnight he became of ghost". The magnitude of this loss was high, as the love of women was his practice and that by which he filled the void imprinted on him by his transaction into the Symbolic Order. Ironically, David's lost motherly union was filled up by many woman, all of whom eventually left him. What's interesting about David's character is that not only is he afraid of intimacy, he is also self-described as hopeless in ways of recovery, claiming he is "old-fashioned" and that he "would prefer simply to be put against a wall and shot" rather than receive concealing. Thus revealing his inflated ego, cause of his problems, as he fails to fixate on his core issues. 

  Lets, for a moment, examine David's first relationship introduced in the novel. David frequents Soraya, a prostitute, once a week, yet his method of sexual gratification with Soraya is one that seeks to be more than a monetary transaction. Despite David's supposedly content arrangement with Soraya, he feels a certain emotional debt towards her. This is manifested when David catches a glance of Soraya and her kids in a restaurant, from this small interaction he immediately feels as if he must protect her, "/Your secret is safe with me/, he would like to say". David projects his own fears onto those around him, feeling as if he must be their protector because he is unable to care for himself, manifested in "a shadow of envy [that]  passes over him for the husband he has never seen". It is with such a statement that we see how David desires more than a woman whom he can have a sexual partnership with, David seeks to protect. 

It is with the rest of the novel that Davids desire to protect is revealed. 

  
  "Barely a term passes when he does not fall for one or other of his charges"

  "He wills the girl to be captivated too. But he senses she is not"

  "She does not withdraw, but does not yield either"
  
  
  As a work of literary fiction, Disgrace dives deep into David's psyche via our third person narrator, focusing on how David perceives things, how he feels, how he remembers, what he imagines, how he connects his own experiences to other works of literature, what he worries about…
to bring shame on yourself or on somebody else.

"
He opens the cage door. 'Come,' he says, bends, opens his arms. The dog wags his crippled rear, sniffs his face, licks his cheeks, his lips, his ears. He does nothing to stop it. 'Come.'

Bearing him in his arms like a lamb, he re-enters the surgery. 'I thought you would save him for another week,' says Bev Shaw. 'Are you giving him up?'

'Yes. I am giving him up.' (24. 62-64)
"

Its period of grace is almost over; soon it will have to submit to the needle" (24. 12)

As things get worse for him and he dives deeper and deeper into shame and disgrace, his character becomes more closely aligned with that of a dog.

"Perhaps that is what I must learn to accept. To start at ground level. With nothing. Not with nothing but. With nothing. No cards, no weapons, no property, no rights, no dignity."

"Like a dog."

"Yes, like a dog." (22.112-114)

David fits a character type called the Byronic Hero, which is loosely based upon Byron himself. Byronic Heroes aren't perfect. They're sophisticated but arrogant, well-educated but highly self-critical, charismatic and seductive but self-destructive and suffering from something that happened in the past. Byron isn't just a figure to whom Coetzee makes reference; both Byron and the figure of the Byronic Hero become symbols of David's own character.

David has an active but passionless sex life; then he gets to know Melanie.

We learn a couple of things about David when the novel begins: he's someone who likes to spend time in bed with the ladies, but he also doesn't feel any passion toward them – nor is he particularly attached to any of them.

He's OK with his job, but he also has a lot of issues with it; he's content enough, but we don't get the impression that he's really happy.


his midlife crisis, and concludes that fear of loneliness, fear of aging,and the fear of death, fear of intimacy.

“The metamorphosis of Lurie’s sublimations –as  in  the  creative  writing  of  an  opera –is  part  of  Lurie’s  emotional development  and  his  sublimated  desire  to  hear  voices  of the  subjugated  [women  in  the novel]” (Segall 51).


  David, being raised by woman, feels a certain connection and affection to them that he deems unique. Yet his way with woman is not one of unconditional love, rather it is a love of the sensations woman bring out from him

  

  The use of dogs is a big symbol of the novel, on the one hand dogs are used to represent the social structure of men, placing humans above dogs, on the other hand they are used to represent Davids own personal growth into and from disgrace.

  Lacan's concept of the Real is one that makes itself ready in the novel, David is in a constant state of loss, always looking to fill in the void left by the incarnation into the Symbolic Order, ironically this whole is filled with woman, first it is Soraya, whom he pays for sex, yet he lacks passion in the relationship and is a simple sexual discharge that maintains his spirits. He leads a passionless life, both in sex, friendships, and work. He has lost his charm with woman and resorts to the use of power abuse in order to rope a young student of his into his bed. Despite her total lack of interest in him, he falls in love with her, in his mind she has filled the gaping hole left there by his many losses. He then uses his dreams of witting his opera to fill the hole of loss, yet is unable to find passion for it. Moving in with his daughter into the country he is introduced to a lifestyle he deems simple.
