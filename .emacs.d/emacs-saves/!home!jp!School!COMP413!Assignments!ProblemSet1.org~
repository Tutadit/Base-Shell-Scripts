\begin{problem}
\begin{answer}
Consider a set $M = {m_1,...,m_n}$ of /n/ men, and a set $W = {w_1,...,w_n}$ of /n/ women. Let $M \times W$ denote the set of all possible ordered pairs of the form $(m, w)$, where $m \in M$ and $w \in W$. A /matching/ $S$ is a /set/ of ordered pairs, each from $M \times W$, with the property that each member of $M$ and each member of $W$ appears in at most one pair in $S$. A /perfect matching/ $S'$ is a matching with the property that each member of $M$ and each member of $W$ appears in /exactly/ one pair in $S'$.
     
     Add /preference/. Each man $m \in M$ /ranks/ all the women; $m$ prefers $w$ to $w'$ if $m$ ranks $w$ higher than $w'$. This ordered ranking of $m$ is his /preference list/. No ties. Same for women.

     A matching $S$ is /stable/ if (i) i is perfect and (ii) there is no instability with respect to $S$.
