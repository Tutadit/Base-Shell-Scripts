*** Passage 2
    This passage is taken from "The Mirror Stage as Formative of the Function of the I as Revealed in Psychoanalytic Experience" by Jaques Lacan. The "Ideal-I" Lacan speaks of is the self before introduction to the world of language. Lacan believes this "Ideal-I" to be the "source of secondary identifications", meaning those moments of identification following the initial identification encountered by the introduction to the Symbolic Order. Lacan places "Libidinal normalization" under "secondary identifications", meaning that sexual desires, a self-discovering ritual, are made as part of the self through identification. Lacan observes how this "ideal-I" holds a pure form of self before its "social determination", meaning before it is made into a socially acceptable human. Lacan notes that within this "Ideal-I", the child is heading towards an unreachable point, a point which must be "resolved as his discordance with his own reality", meaning that the reality of the Ideeal-I is not that of the social reality, and thus the child will need to deal with such differences in reality.
