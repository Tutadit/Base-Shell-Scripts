Richard Posner believes in complete transparency in regards to personal information, pointing out that those who demand the right to privacy are likely to do so in order to gain an edge over someone. In his views he views the "economics" of privacy, noting how one must "pay" in order to protect their privacy, and those who can gain an edge by accessing the private information of others will also "pay" in order to gain such information. He notes how by having an active privacy there is expenses in all parties involved. He also notes that the more one knows about these they relate to, the better. He comes from the side of privacy that limits the access to potential risks by associating with a particular person, where as if privacy was a non issue one could know all necessary information and with that decide if the relationship shall continue or end. Posner is thus afraid of the possible  problems that privacy as a right entail. 

While I understand Posner's point, and I agree that issues in regard to what one can keep private can arise. However I believe the problems that arise with a disregard for privacy are harder to prevent and even spot than those problems that arise when privacy is set as a right. The problems with the right to privacy that Posner brings about, are evident where as the problems that arise when no privacy is entailed are often hidden. For example as an employer having access to relevant employee information is essential to pick a proper staff. Within this example if privacy was a non-issue then the employer would have access to all of the applicants personal information and use that to best decide who is fit for the job. The problem with such an open access to personal information is the chance for employers to discriminate against applicants for issues unrelated to the job itself, (for example a sickness, a woman and the possibility of her becoming pregnant, and so on).

Posner is set on the maliciousness of humans and their disregard for others in order to achieve their goals. He uses this maliciousness as the reason why he is against privacy as a right, however the same maliciousness of humans can be used to defend the right for privacy, as explained in the example above. And those malicious acts are much harder to detect and even harder to prove, where as problems arising from the malice uses of privacy (such as hiding relevant information) can be detected and proven.

Ultimately I understand Posner's preoccupations with having privacy as a right, people are going to abuse of this right and want to use it to hide required information, and often one must dig into someone to find out if they are indeed hiding anything. This digging creates the risk of violating the persons privacy as well as being a costly errand. Thus as a person who is threatened by others privacy, one must be careful with who they interact with and if a problem arises it can be dealt with as the problem will have proper cause and evidence (for example finding out that an employee lied on their resume). 

It is clear to me that the right of privacy has it's issues and those issues are hard to describe as a simple rule of law, for they vary from case to case. Posner's believes are plausible and likely to occur, thus the issue of privacy has to be looked at taking Posner's considerations in mind as well as the opposite considerations where having no privacy negatively affects citizens.
